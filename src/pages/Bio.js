      <h3>
        Where I&#39;m at. Where I&#39;ve been.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently I lead software teams as part of the Kindle group at Amazon,
        focusing on creating the best possible reading experience for digital comics.
      </p>
      <p>

        Iâ€™ve been a director of technology for content systems and APIs at&nbsp;
        <a href="http://nbcnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          NBC News Digital
        </a>
        , focusing on CMSs and APIs that power high-velocity news reporting.
        Before that, I was a director and creative technologist at&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.ideo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          IDEO
        </a>
        , focusing on the intersection of design and technology to launch new
        products and change big systems.  I helped create models of shared mobility
        for the government of Sweeden, designed software for flood resiliency for
        New Yorkers post Superstorm Sandy, and created collaboration tools for the
        Department of State.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped start the Digital Media Group at&nbsp;
        <a href="https://marvel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Marvel Entertainment
        </a>
        &nbsp;and created things like the first digital comics program backed by the
        comic industry, the first developer program in the comics industry, and
        used graph theory to understand the complexities of the Marvel Universe.
